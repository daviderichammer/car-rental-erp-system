## Database Architecture Overview {#database-architecture}

### Primary Database Design

The car rental ERP system utilizes a multi-tier database architecture designed to support high availability, scalability, and performance requirements. PostgreSQL serves as the primary relational database management system, chosen for its robust ACID compliance, advanced indexing capabilities, and excellent support for complex queries and transactions.

The database architecture implements a master-slave replication pattern with read replicas to distribute query load and improve performance for read-heavy operations such as vehicle searches, availability checking, and reporting functions. Write operations are directed to the master database to ensure data consistency, while read operations can be distributed across multiple read replicas based on geographic location and load balancing requirements.

**Database Naming Conventions** follow consistent patterns to ensure maintainability and clarity. Table names use lowercase with underscores for word separation (e.g., `rental_agreements`, `vehicle_categories`). Primary keys follow the pattern `table_name_id` (e.g., `customer_id`, `vehicle_id`). Foreign keys maintain clear relationships with descriptive names that indicate the referenced table and purpose.

**Data Types and Constraints** are carefully selected to ensure data integrity and optimal storage efficiency. Monetary values use the DECIMAL data type with appropriate precision to avoid floating-point arithmetic issues. Timestamps include timezone information using TIMESTAMPTZ to support global operations. String fields implement appropriate length constraints based on business requirements and validation rules.

### Supplementary Data Stores

**Redis Cache Layer** provides high-performance caching for frequently accessed data including vehicle availability, pricing information, and user session data. The cache implementation uses intelligent cache invalidation strategies that maintain data consistency while maximizing performance benefits. Session management utilizes Redis for scalable session storage that supports load balancing across multiple application servers.

**Elasticsearch Search Engine** enables advanced search capabilities for vehicles, customers, and reservations with full-text search, faceted filtering, and real-time indexing. The search implementation supports complex queries including geographic searches, availability filtering, and recommendation engines that enhance user experience and operational efficiency.

**File Storage System** utilizes cloud-based object storage for documents, images, and other binary data. Vehicle images, customer documents, damage photos, and system backups are stored in AWS S3 or equivalent cloud storage with appropriate access controls and lifecycle management policies.


## Core Entity Design {#core-entities}

## Relationship Mapping {#relationships}

### Primary Relationships

The database design implements a comprehensive relationship structure that ensures data integrity while supporting complex business operations. The relationship mapping follows established database design principles with appropriate foreign key constraints, cascade rules, and referential integrity controls.

**User-Customer Relationship** establishes a one-to-one relationship between the users table and customers table, enabling shared authentication and authorization while maintaining customer-specific data separation. This design supports future expansion to other user types such as vendors or partners without requiring schema modifications.

**Vehicle-Category Relationship** implements a many-to-one relationship that enables flexible vehicle classification and pricing strategies. Each vehicle belongs to exactly one category, while categories can contain multiple vehicles. This design supports dynamic pricing based on category-level rules while maintaining vehicle-specific overrides when necessary.

**Reservation-Vehicle Relationship** supports both category-based reservations and specific vehicle assignments through a flexible design that accommodates various booking scenarios. Initial reservations specify vehicle categories, with specific vehicle assignments made during the rental process based on availability and customer preferences.

**Location-Based Relationships** enable multi-location operations with support for pickup and return location differences, vehicle transfers, and geographic distribution strategies. The design accommodates various location types and operational models while maintaining consistency and data integrity.

### Complex Relationship Patterns

**Hierarchical Role Structure** implements parent-child relationships within the user_roles table that enable role inheritance and simplified permission management. This design supports organizational hierarchies while maintaining flexibility for complex permission scenarios.

**Audit Trail Relationships** maintain comprehensive tracking of all data modifications through created_by and updated_by relationships that reference the users table. This design ensures accountability and supports compliance requirements while enabling detailed system usage analysis.

**Financial Transaction Relationships** link payments, invoices, and reservations through a flexible design that supports various billing scenarios including split billing, corporate accounts, and complex pricing arrangements. The design maintains transaction integrity while supporting reconciliation and financial reporting requirements.

## Data Security and Privacy {#data-security}

### Encryption and Data Protection

The database design implements comprehensive data protection measures that address regulatory requirements and business security needs. Sensitive data fields including customer personal information, payment details, and business-critical data are protected through multiple security layers.

**Column-Level Encryption** protects highly sensitive data including driver license numbers, payment information, and personal identification data using AES-256 encryption with proper key management and rotation procedures. The encryption implementation uses database-native encryption features where available, with application-level encryption for additional protection layers.

## Performance Optimization {#performance}

### Indexing Strategy

The database design implements a comprehensive indexing strategy that optimizes query performance while maintaining reasonable storage overhead and update performance. Primary indexes support common query patterns including vehicle searches, availability checking, and customer lookups.

**Composite Indexes** optimize complex queries that involve multiple columns, particularly for reservation searches, vehicle availability queries, and financial reporting. The indexing strategy considers query frequency, selectivity, and maintenance overhead to ensure optimal performance across all operational scenarios.

**Partial Indexes** optimize queries on filtered datasets, particularly for active records, available vehicles, and current reservations. This approach reduces index size and maintenance overhead while providing optimal performance for common operational queries.

### Query Optimization

**Materialized Views** provide pre-computed results for complex analytical queries including fleet utilization reports, revenue analytics, and customer behavior analysis. The materialized view strategy balances data freshness requirements with query performance needs through intelligent refresh scheduling.

**Partitioning Strategy** implements table partitioning for large historical datasets including reservations, payments, and maintenance records. The partitioning approach uses time-based partitioning that aligns with business reporting cycles and data retention policies while maintaining query performance and management efficiency.


## API Architecture Design {#api-architecture}

### RESTful API Design Principles

The car rental ERP system implements a comprehensive RESTful API architecture that follows industry best practices for resource design, HTTP method usage, and response formatting. The API design prioritizes consistency, discoverability, and ease of integration while maintaining security and performance requirements.

**Resource Naming Conventions** follow RESTful principles with plural nouns for collections and clear hierarchical relationships. API endpoints use consistent URL patterns such as `/api/v1/vehicles`, `/api/v1/reservations/{id}`, and `/api/v1/customers/{id}/reservations` that provide intuitive navigation and resource relationships.

**HTTP Method Implementation** follows standard REST conventions with GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PUT for complete updates, PATCH for partial updates, and DELETE for removal. The API implements proper HTTP status codes including 200 for success, 201 for creation, 400 for client errors, 401 for authentication failures, 403 for authorization failures, 404 for not found, and 500 for server errors.

**Response Format Standardization** implements consistent JSON response structures with standardized error handling, pagination, and metadata inclusion. All responses include appropriate headers for caching, content type, and API versioning while maintaining backward compatibility through versioned endpoints.

### Core API Endpoints

**Rate Limiting Implementation** protects against abuse and ensures fair resource usage through configurable rate limits based on user type, API endpoint, and authentication method. The rate limiting system implements sliding window algorithms with appropriate error responses and retry-after headers.

**Input Validation and Sanitization** ensures data integrity and security through comprehensive validation of all input parameters, request bodies, and file uploads. The validation system implements schema-based validation with detailed error messages and security filtering to prevent injection attacks.

## Microservices Design {#microservices}

### Service Decomposition Strategy

The car rental ERP system implements a microservices architecture that decomposes the monolithic application into focused, independently deployable services aligned with business capabilities and data ownership patterns.

**User Management Service** handles authentication, authorization, user profiles, and role management with dedicated database schemas and independent deployment capabilities. This service provides centralized identity management while enabling other services to focus on their core business logic.

**Vehicle Management Service** manages the complete vehicle lifecycle including inventory, maintenance, tracking, and availability with real-time status updates and integration with external telematics systems. The service maintains vehicle data ownership while providing APIs for other services to access vehicle information.

**Reservation Service** handles the booking process, availability checking, and reservation management with complex business logic for pricing, allocation, and modification scenarios. This service coordinates with other services through well-defined APIs while maintaining reservation data consistency.

**Payment Service** processes financial transactions, manages billing, and handles payment gateway integrations with PCI DSS compliance and secure data handling. The service isolates financial data and processing logic while providing secure APIs for other services.

**Notification Service** manages customer communications, system alerts, and marketing campaigns with support for multiple communication channels and personalization capabilities. This service centralizes communication logic while enabling other services to trigger notifications through simple APIs.

### Inter-Service Communication

**Synchronous Communication** uses HTTP/REST APIs for real-time operations that require immediate responses such as availability checking, payment processing, and user authentication. The communication implements circuit breaker patterns, timeout controls, and retry mechanisms to ensure resilience.

**Asynchronous Communication** uses message queues and event streaming for operations that can be processed asynchronously such as notifications, analytics updates, and audit logging. The event-driven architecture enables loose coupling while ensuring eventual consistency across services.

**Data Consistency Patterns** implement saga patterns for distributed transactions that span multiple services, ensuring data consistency without requiring distributed transactions. The implementation includes compensation mechanisms and failure handling to maintain system integrity.

### Service Discovery and Configuration

**Service Registry** provides dynamic service discovery with health checking and load balancing capabilities that enable services to find and communicate with each other without hard-coded dependencies. The registry supports multiple deployment environments and automatic service registration.

**Configuration Management** centralizes configuration data with environment-specific settings, feature flags, and runtime configuration updates without requiring service restarts. The configuration system implements security controls and audit trails for configuration changes.

**API Gateway Integration** provides centralized routing, authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring for all inter-service communication while enabling independent service evolution and deployment.

## Data Migration Strategy {#data-migration}

### Migration Planning and Execution

The data migration strategy addresses the transition from existing systems to the new car rental ERP system with minimal business disruption and data integrity assurance. The migration approach implements phased rollouts with comprehensive testing and rollback capabilities.

**Data Assessment and Mapping** identifies all existing data sources, formats, and quality issues while creating detailed mapping specifications for data transformation and validation. The assessment includes data volume analysis, dependency mapping, and quality scoring to inform migration planning.

**Migration Tools and Processes** implement automated migration scripts with comprehensive logging, error handling, and progress monitoring capabilities. The tools support both full migrations and incremental updates with data validation and reconciliation features.

**Testing and Validation** procedures ensure data accuracy and completeness through automated testing, sample validation, and business user acceptance testing. The validation process includes data quality checks, business rule validation, and performance testing under realistic load conditions.

### Rollback and Recovery Procedures

**Backup and Recovery Strategy** maintains comprehensive backups of all data throughout the migration process with point-in-time recovery capabilities and tested restoration procedures. The backup strategy includes both database backups and application-level data exports for maximum flexibility.

**Rollback Planning** provides detailed procedures for reverting to previous systems in case of migration failures or critical issues. The rollback plan includes data synchronization procedures, system configuration restoration, and user communication protocols.

**Monitoring and Alerting** systems track migration progress, data quality metrics, and system performance with automated alerting for issues that require immediate attention. The monitoring includes business metrics validation and user experience tracking to ensure successful migration outcomes.
