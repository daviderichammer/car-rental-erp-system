- [x] Fixed reservation display (dates, amounts, customer/vehicle info)
- [x] Fixed maintenance display (costs, descriptions, service types)
- [x] Fixed maintenance scheduling (date format, field mapping)
- [x] Fixed financial transaction creation (required fields, API mapping)
- [x] All modules now 100% functional

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED PHASE: Error Handling Enhancement

### Phase 1: Analysis ‚úÖ
- [x] Identified all JavaScript functions that could cause system-wide failures
- [x] Mapped error-prone areas (API calls, DOM manipulation, data processing)
- [x] Documented current error handling gaps
- [x] Planned comprehensive try/catch implementation strategy

### Phase 2: Implementation ‚úÖ
- [x] Add try/catch blocks to all API call functions
- [x] Wrap DOM manipulation in error handlers
- [x] Implement graceful degradation for failed operations
- [x] Add input validation with error handling
- [x] Create centralized error logging system
- [x] Enhanced Dashboard functions with error handling ‚úÖ
- [x] Enhanced Vehicle Management with error handling ‚úÖ
- [x] Enhanced Customer Management with error handling ‚úÖ
- [x] Enhanced Reservation Management with error handling ‚úÖ
- [x] Enhanced Maintenance Management with error handling ‚úÖ
- [x] Enhanced Financial Management with error handling ‚úÖ
- [x] Enhanced Reports with error handling ‚úÖ

### Phase 3: User Experience ‚úÖ
- [x] Replace generic error messages with user-friendly ones
- [x] Add loading states and error recovery options
- [x] Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations
- [x] Add toast notifications for better UX

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment ‚úÖ
- [x] Test error scenarios (network failures, invalid inputs)
- [x] Verify system continues working when individual functions fail
- [x] Deploy enhanced system to production
- [x] Commit changes to GitHub repository

### Phase 5: Documentation ‚è≥
- [ ] Document error handling improvements
- [ ] Create user guide for error scenarios
- [ ] Update system documentation
- [ ] Add loading states and error recovery options
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations
- [ ] Add toast notifications for better UX

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment üìã
- [ ] Test error scenarios (network failures, invalid inputs)
- [ ] Verify system continues working when individual functions fail
- [ ] Deploy enhanced system to production
- [ ] Commit changes to GitHub repository

### Phase 5: Documentation üìã
- [ ] Document error handling improvements
- [ ] Create user guide for error scenarios
- [ ] Update system documentation

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS:
- System remains functional even when individual components fail
- User-friendly error messages instead of JavaScript errors
- Graceful degradation of functionality
- Improved system reliability and maintainability

## üìä CURRENT STATUS: 95% Complete
**Next Action**: Analyze JavaScript functions for error handling implementation
